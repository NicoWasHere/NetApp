# NetApp
Net is a money tracking app that allows you to keep track of what money you and your friends owe each other. When you lend someone $5 to buy some food at the mall, just pull out Net and record it. Then later when you borrow $5 from them, you can pull out Net and the two will just cancel out. Net allows you to to lend each other money without actually having to have any money actually be traded around. It makes it super easy to tell if you have have been freeloading a little bit too much, or if someone else owes you big time.
